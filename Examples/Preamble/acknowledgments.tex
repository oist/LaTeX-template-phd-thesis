\chapter*{Acknowledgment} 

First of all, I would like to thank to my advisor, Thierry Bastin, who led my efforts for four years. I learned many things on this journey and, more often than not, you were the one teaching them to me.

I want to give many thanks to Girish S.~Agarwal, who co-advised me and welcomed me three times to his group in Oklahoma State University for the grand total of one year. That year was synonym of hard work and of many, many breakthroughs. I also want to thank everybody of the Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Science Group at OSU, you guys were an essential part of my adventure, I was lucky to meet you.

I vehemently thank all the members of the IPNAS in Li\`ege, you are amazing, how do you do it? This place is like a second home to me, especially on Fridays. My second family is located elsewhere, though. Cross the street, enter the building, go up four floors. Fourth floorers and affiliated were sometimes the only thing that kept me going, may our friendship never die.

I will keep it short and not mention anybody else by name but chances are, if you are reading this thesis, you had some role to play in its development. I want you to pat yourself on the back and receive all my  gratitude, that's probably the least you deserve.
